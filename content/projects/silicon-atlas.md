# Silicon Atlas - Deep Dive

This was a project I wanted to build for a while: I really wanted to make the semiconductor industry more accessible and vulgarized for people who do not necessarily have a deep technical background.

I've built interactive timeline and map while learning how to play with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, TypeScript for robust, maintainable code, Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive styling and React for UI compnents.

Really liked it overall
